# Project 11 WAR Card Game

This is project called "WAR" the card game.

This game is based on terminal.

This game have two modes Player VS Computer and Player VS Player.

RULES :- 
The goal is to be the first player to win all 52 cards

THE DEAL
The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places their stack of cards face down, in front of them.

THE PLAY
Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.
If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up one card face down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles (21 cards) because i have set to deal 10 cards by each player in case of war (NOTE:-You can set any limits like 3,5,10,etc.). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places another card face down and turns another card face up. The player with the higher card takes all dealed cards, and so on.

HOW TO KEEP SCORE
The game ends when one player has won all the cards.

The program is very simple go through it and you will understand it.

Added docstring and comments wherever it is necessary.

This is my version of this game maybe there will be more efficient code than this.

HAVE FUN!
